    <h2>Why Pasta?</h2>
    <p>Pasta bake with sausage (baked ziti) is basically a lazy day lasagna with layers of pasta tossed in a rich tomato meat sauce packed with Italian sausage, layered with lots of gooey golden mozzarella cheese, and baked to perfection. It's an easy and delicious casserole dinner to make any day of the week.</p>
    
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Penne pasta</li>
        <li>Olive oil</li>
        <li>Italian Sausage</li>
        <li>Onion</li>
        <li>Garlic</li>
        <li>Tomato sauce</li>
        <li>Herbs</li>
        <li>Cheese</li>
        <li>Salt & Pepper</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Boil the pasta</strong>. Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil over medium-high heat. Add pasta and cook until al dente (fully cooked but still firm), about 8-10 minutes, or according to package directions. Drain well and set aside.</li>
        <li><strong>Cook the sausage</strong>. Meanwhile, heat olive oil in a large pot (or 4 qt. Dutch oven) for 2 minutes over medium-high heat until the hot oil sizzles. Add sausage and stir to cook until browned, about 5-7 minutes. Use a spatula to break the sausages into small pieces. Add onions and garlic and sauté until soft and tender, about 2-3 minutes. Stir to combine.</li>
        <li><strong>Make the sauce</strong>. Pour in tomato sauce, turn the heat down to medium, and bring the meat sauce to a simmer, stirring occasionally. Stir in Italian seasoning, ½ cup Parmesan cheese, parsley and basil. Season with salt and pepper. Turn the heat down to low and simmer for 5-7 minutes, stirring occasionally. Simmering helps develop richer flavour in the sauce.</li>
        <li><strong>Add the pasta</strong>. Transfer the cooked and drained pasta into the sauce and toss well to mix evenly.</li>
    </ol>
